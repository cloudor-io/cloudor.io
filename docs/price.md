# Overview

Currently, `cloudor` is a `pay-as-you-go` service. No monthly fee is required to stay active.
Newly registered users are given $5 credit automatically.
This covers about a couple of hours of instance time on our supported cloud instances.

The cost of a job basically consists of instance cost, data cost and network cost. 

Please note that it is important to keep the credit positive to run cloudor jobs. The job's estimate cost is done based on the vendor, region, instance type and timeout value at the submission. The cost is preserved before the job is started and the job may be rejected due to insufficient credit remaining.

The user credit can be managed at the cloudor's user console.
